(Yes, vim is not bash but I didn't feel like making an entirely new setup just for vim.)

# Search

If you want to search for stuff in vim you can use `/` to search backwards and `?` to search forwards

Example: `/foo` will search the rest of the document (from the cursor position) for the next instance of `foo`. `?foo` will search backwards from the cursor.
